# Secure Private Messaging and File Transfer Server

A secure, hardened Windows Server 2022 deployment for private, end-to-end encrypted file transfers and messaging using OpenSSH, SFTP, and PowerShell.

## Project Summary
Deployed a secure Windows Server to enable encrypted messaging and file transfers without third-party services. Implemented system hardening, firewall rules, SSH key authentication, service monitoring, and backup systems to ensure privacy, security, and resilience.

## Technologies Used
- Windows Server 2022
- OpenSSH Server
- SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)
- PowerShell Scripting
- Windows Firewall
- Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit (LGPO)
- Task Scheduler (for backups and monitoring)

## Security Features
- Public Key Authentication (no passwords)
- SSH Hardening:
  - Disabled root login
  - Enforced strong ciphers and key exchange algorithms
  - Session timeouts to prevent idle abuse
- Hardened Windows Firewall:
  - Only Port 22 (SSH/SFTP) open
  - All other ports closed
- Microsoft Security Baseline Applied
- Disabled legacy insecure protocols:
  - SMBv1
  - TLS 1.0/1.1

## How to Connect
```bash
# SSH Secure Login
ssh username@server_ip

# Secure File Transfer via SFTP
sftp username@server_ip
```
- Authentication is handled via public key, ensuring no passwords are transmitted.
- All data is end-to-end encrypted using SSH tunnels.

## Encryption Details
- End-to-end encrypted SSH sessions using AES-256 or ChaCha20 ciphers.
- Public key authentication protects against brute-force and credential theft.
- No third-party services â€” complete privacy and control over sensitive data.

## Scripts
- **Monitor-SSHD.ps1**  
  PowerShell script to monitor the SSHD service and log service health status to a log file and Windows Event Log.

## Backup and Recovery
Configured Windows Server Backup for:
- Daily incremental backups
- Weekly full backups
- Backup to an external disk or secure offsite storage
